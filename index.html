        <h1>Hello, I'm Pedro Q. Neves.</h1>
       
        <p>  I've always been driven by two passions: technology and economics. It was with great enthusiasm that I found a way to unite these two forces into one purpose. </p>
  
          <p>Just six months ago, I decided to embark on a new journey. As the saying goes, "every great journey starts with a small step", and here I am, taking my first yet firm and decisive steps.</p>
          
          <p>I like to tinker with programming languages such as Python and JavaScript, but that's not all. What truly motivates me is applying these skills to create economic analyses with statistics and simulation systems. I genuinely believe that it's when these two areas - technology and economics - meet that we can make amazing things happen.</p>
  
          <p>I am not just a programmer or economist. I am a bridge between these two worlds. What you'll find here on this site are not just projects and ideas, but also my vision and my efforts to create a future where economics and technology can work together for the benefit of all.</p>
  
          <p>This isn't about me, it's about us. I'm inviting you to join me on this journey. To learn, to grow, to explore the unlimited possibilities that arise when we bring together technology and economics.</p>
  
          <p>Thank you for being here. I'm looking forward to seeing what we can achieve together.</p>

          <p>The intersection of <span class="highlight">technology</span> and <span class="highlight">economics</span> has always fascinated me. With a commitment to both fields, I've found a purpose that combines these distinct passions.</p>
      
          <p>A mere six months ago, I ventured into a new phase of my professional journey. They say every remarkable journey starts with a single step, and I find myself on this path, determined and forward-looking.</p>
      
          <p>Beyond programming languages like Python and JavaScript, I'm compelled by the application of these skills to derive profound economic analyses, leveraging statistical methods and advanced simulation systems. It's in the confluence of technology and economics that transformative ideas emerge.</p>
      
          <p>I position myself not just as a programmer or an economist but as a confluence of these disciplines, striving for a future where both realms collaborate for overarching success.</p>
      
          <p>This platform is a testament to that vision and my efforts. Welcome to this narrative of blending technology with economics.</p>
